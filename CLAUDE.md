## Code Style Guidelines

### HTML
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<section>`, `<header>`, etc.)
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Keep classes descriptive and follow kebab-case (e.g., `free-chapter`)

### CSS
- Follow the existing component structure in styles.css
- Selectors should be descriptive and specific
- Use the existing color scheme (`#0070ad` for primary actions)
- Mobile responsiveness handled through media queries

### JavaScript
- Currently no JavaScript files in the project
- If adding, use ES6+ syntax and follow existing conventions

### Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for CSS classes and IDs
- Maintain meaningful and descriptive names
